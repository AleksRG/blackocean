## Model Providers

This template ships with OpenAI `gpt-3.5-turbo` as the default.

## Running locally

You will need to use the environment variables [defined in `.env.example`](.env.example) to run Black Oceane AI Chatbot. It's recommended you use [Vercel Environment Variables](https://vercel.com/docs/concepts/projects/environment-variables) for this, but a `.env` file is all that is necessary.

> Note: You should not commit your `.env` file or it will expose secrets that will allow others to control access to your various OpenAI and authentication provider accounts.

```bash
npm install
npm dev
```

Your app template should now be running on [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000/).
